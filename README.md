# lc-solutions

Recently been doing some leetcode work and realized that it would never show up on github so some days my commit contributions is basically nothing.
So now I'll upload my solutions in JavaScript for practice since I've been writing it a lot recently and it's good practice.

Time constraints that I use: Time capped at 40 mins for medium and easy, 1 hour for hards.
Although I tend to not want to do hards as much as they are generally more tedious than actually difficult.
